Test 2:
**************************************************************************************************
We need a way of finding all the occurrences of a particular set of characters in a string.
   We need a class that has a public method named “Find” that returns a string
   This method accepts two strings as input. One called 'textToSearch' and one called 'subtext'
   The solution should match the subtext against the textToSearch, outputting the positions of  the beginning of each match for the subtext within the textToSearch.
   Multiple matches are possible
   Matching is case insensitive
   If no matches have been found, “<No Output>” is generated
**************************************************************************************************
Solution
---------
Set Test2 as startup project Run the console application.
  
All unit tests are in Test2.Tests.

public method named “Find” is in Test2.Classes - > SubString.cs file.
